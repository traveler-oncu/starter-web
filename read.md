first version
this is to be moved all the way up to git hub.

This is the second version.
I want this to be in the repository completely.
But I don't want it in GitHub.
So, I'll add and commit but no push.

In the third version I leave it in staging.
I will add.  But I will not commit.

I create a fourth version.
One I never added nor committed.

adding a change for cr1, the first change.
adding change for auto merge.

Adding changes on master to rebase., then more changes from my cr3 branch too.
Adding changes for stashing, this is LEVEL2
